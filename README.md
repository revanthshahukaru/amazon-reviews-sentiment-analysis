This is a repository that contains the code for the project that I have been working on - Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews dataset using NLP techniques.
Things to note-
This repo does not have the data folder as it is a huge folder containing 500,000 Amazon Reviews which is of size around 2GB.
I also did not upoload the saved pickle file of the model as it was around 2GB as well.
However, by running the code of nlp/01-machine_learning/2024-04-20_ml-final.ipynb file, we can save the pickle file for the model.
