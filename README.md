This is a repository that contains the code for the project that I have been working on - Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews dataset using NLP techniques.

Things to note-

- This repo does not have the data folder as it is a huge folder containing **500,000 Amazon Reviews** which is of size around 2GB.
- You can find the text data in this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0QGzCYvQxlgv83Ojmr9kmLGrlg98o6P/view
- I also did not upoload the saved pickle file of the model as it was around 2GB as well. However, by running the code of **nlp/01-machine_learning/2024-04-20_ml-final.ipynb** file, we can save the pickle file for the model.
- It is also better to create a virtual environment and install all the required packages when trying to run the flask application on your system.
